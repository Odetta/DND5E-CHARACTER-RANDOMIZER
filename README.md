Click “Create!” to roll a randomized level 1 character

All aspects are randomized, with some exceptions granted to things like cleric deities matching alignment, fighter starting equipment matching their fighting style, etc.

Use the tabs in the first column to customize the corresponding array: race, class, background, alignment, trinkets, and magic items

This can be used to set boundaries when rolling a character, such as removing the option to roll a chaotic evil alignment, or unchecking all backgrounds except the handful that you’re interested in
